//Primitive Data Types

// 7 types: String,Number,Boolean,null,undefined,Symbol,BigInt


//JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that data types of variables are determined by the value they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them.


const score=100
const scoreValue=100.3
//The above two defined variables is in Number Type

const isLoggedIn = false
const outsideTemp= null // null means empty not zero value

let userEmail; // If we can't defined any value then it is undefined
